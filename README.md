# Motor_IMU_Shield

This is an Arduino library for an Arduino "Shield" designed for the Arduino Uno (Should be Widely Compatibile with other Arduinos i.e. Mega) which provides 4 Brushless DC Motor Drivers and an integrated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The Motor Controllers are Allegro MicroSystems A4963's and the IMU is a Bosch Sensortec BNO055. PCB files are available at [https://github.com/lazerj7/Motor_IMU_Shield_PCB](https://github.com/lazerj7/Motor_IMU_Shield_PCB).
